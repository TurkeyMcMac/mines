This is a mine finding game that is basically a clone of Minesweeper. The
purpose is to flag all the mines hidden under tiles on the board. You must flag
the correct tiles, and nothing more, to win. If a tile has one or more mines
adjacent or immediately diagonal, it is displayed as that number from 1 to 8.
Try to reveal tiles which you know to be safe to isolate the mines.

My version is controlled using commands over the command line. You can get
specifics by running `make` then `./mines -help`. You only need ANSI C, although
I don't think the makefile will work on Windows, so you'll have to compile the
program manually there.
